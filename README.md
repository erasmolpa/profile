## 🧠 Profile

Engineering leader with almost 20 years of experience building systems, enabling teams, and driving DevOps and SRE practices at scale.

I focus on delivering value through **clarity**, **reliability**, and **technical ownership** — across platforms, teams, and time zones.

My approach blends:

- 🧠 Systems thinking over tool obsession  
- 🤝 Collaboration over silos  
- 🚢 Shipping real work over slide decks  
- 📈 Enablement over control  

Whether I’m writing code, mentoring engineers, or designing a platform strategy — I care about what lasts, what scales, and what helps people do great work.

- Balance engineering excellence with pragmatism, clarity, and mentorship  
- Build tooling, templates, and standards that scale across teams and regions  
- Advocate for feedback-driven culture, reliability as a mindset, and infrastructure as product
